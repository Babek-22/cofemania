# Coffee Order Application

Welcome to the Coffee Order Application, a simple Python console-based program that allows users to order their favorite coffee drinks. This application provides a basic ordering system with a menu, quantity selection, and a receipt feature to calculate the total cost of the order.

## Features

- **Menu Display:** The application displays a menu with a list of coffee options, including names and prices.

- **Order Placement:** Users can select coffee drinks from the menu and specify the quantity they want to order.

- **Receipt Generation:** After placing their order, the application generates a receipt that lists the ordered items and calculates the total cost.

- **Flexibility:** Users can add multiple coffee items to their order and see the total cost before finalizing it.

## How to Use

1. Run the `coffee_order_app.py` script in your Python environment.

2. The application will display the coffee menu with options and prices.

3. Enter the number corresponding to your desired coffee choice (e.g., "1" for Espresso).

4. Specify the quantity you want to order.

5. Continue adding more items or enter "0" to finish your order.

6. The application will generate a receipt showing the items you ordered and the total cost.

7. Thank you for ordering with us!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

You can run this application locally on your machine with Python installed. Customize the menu items and prices to fit your coffee shop's offerings by editing the `CoffeeOrder` class in the `coffee_order_app.py` file.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future enhancements to make this application even better:

- Implement a user authentication system to track and save orders for different users.

- Add a database to store and retrieve order history.

- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter or a web-based interface using Flask or Django.

- Allow users to customize their coffee orders (e.g., choose size, type of milk, sugar level).

- Offer promotions and discounts based on order size or frequency.
